# OSDev

## Description

OSDev (it hasn't any name right now) is an innovative open-source kernel project designed to democratize operating
system development. It provides a foundation that allows developers, regardless of their expertise level,
to build their own custom operating systems. By abstracting complex low-level operations, OSDev makes OS
development more accessible while maintaining the flexibility for advanced customization.
